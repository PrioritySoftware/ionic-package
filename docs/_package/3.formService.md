## FormService
The FormService is an angular service that constitutes as a high level api on top of the [Priority Web SDK](/api) for forms. It provides functions that perform several related actions on a form for easier usage of the SDK. 

It also deals with storing locally the form's data that was retrieved, to enable sharing it between different pages and components in your app.

Another great built in feature of the `FormService` is that it handles all massages returned by the server from the [`MessagesCallback`](/api/global/#MessagesCallback), by alerting them using the [`MessageHandler`](/priority-ionic/Handlers/#MessageHandler).

In addition it also handles updating the local form's data returned by the server from the [`UpdateFormCallback`](/api/global/#UpdateFormCallback), making sure your local data is always up to date.
